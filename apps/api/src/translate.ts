 *   - สี่ทุ่ม (10pm) came back as "4 PM" — Thai counts evening hours in ทุ่ม, not on a 24h dial
 *   - "My Thai isn't very good yet" was flipped into "Your Thai isn't good enough, right?"
 *   - ท่าแพเกท and ถนนเดินเท้า — literal transliterations instead of ประตูท่าแพ and ถนนคนเดิน
 *   - a female pronoun (ฉัน) under a male particle (ครับ)
 * The rules are stated flatly and early; examples live in the fixtures, not here, so the prompt
 * stays short enough to be read at a glance.
